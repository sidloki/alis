Most hearing aids can receive signals <b>wirelessly</b> in cinemas, theatre, churches, lecture halls, etc. You will hear <b>clearly at full volume without reverberation or background noise</b>. This makes it possible to understand any conversation, even in large meeting rooms full of people. Hearing assistance systems are provided at more than 2,000 locations in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>It‘s really quite simple. You only need to switch your hearing aid to <b>T-mode</b>. This is done with the push of a button on your hearing aid or its remote control. If you don‘t know where to find this button, just ask your <b>hearing aid technician</b> how to set up T-mode or inductive reception.</p>\n<p><b>Hearing aids</b> come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from small in-ear devices to behind-the-ear devices to specialised hearing aids such as cochlear implants.</p>\n<p>Does your hearing aid also have a telecoil?
